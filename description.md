# Project Description:
### _Our website will be a redesign of the official PUSD Career Technical Education webpage._

- Our sponsor is Ms. Stevenson from the Poway Career Technical Education Branch. We will be not only redesigning the official webpage on our site, but we will also integrate more features and make the website more interactable with a goal of retaining user interest.


### Hosting

- Temporarily we will use a test server running on our local machines
- We can use AWS to deploy on our own, but we hope to use district servers to host the website.

### License - [[Link to License]](https://github.com/LindaLiu1202/just_here_to_code/blob/main/LICENSE)

- We are using an MIT license, because there is snot much reason for anyone to distribute the Poway CTE website. All we have to do is disclose the license and copyright information.
